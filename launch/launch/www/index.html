                	<h3>Discussion: Industry Research and Project Intent</h3>
                		<p><strong>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</strong></p>
                		<p>Using only HTML/CSS/JS on a web app it appears that you can't access the geolocation, accelerometer, sound, and vibration on the device, so other native features may be accesible.</p>
                		<p><strong>For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?</strong></p>
                		<p>In my Kid Tracks CRUD app I hope to successfully implement the Camera since it would be a neat feature to add pics from events, and I would like to add the ability to send a track (event) to a contact via text message or email, Geolocation would also be a neat addition to my app.</p>
                		<p><strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong></p>
                		<p>Some past lessons learned regarding workflow in research, design and development are that it's most important to get the essentials working first and foremost and make it pretty later if there is time, start early and be prepared for things to go wrong, especially when committing and pushing to github.</p>
                		<p><strong>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</strong></p>
                		<p>I would like to add the native features as listed above to the AVF Demo app and the revised version of my CRUD app just to make the app more than just a standard data saving app, it would be nice to have the camera and contact integrations to make it more personal and functional.</p>

                	<h3>Discussion: Accessibility</h3>
                		<p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong></p>
                		<p>One way to change the HTML on my demo app to be more accessible would be to make sure the HTML is set up in the most simplistic way to accomodate screen readers and allow for more user-friendly navigation by limiting user frustration when there are too many generic tags on a page.</p>
                		<p><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</strong></p>
                		<p>Some common frustrations seem to be when a page hasn't been coded in a user-friendly manner and it doesn't give the user details on certain elements on the page or gives the users too much information at one time rather than in increments as they would scroll down the page for example.</p>
                		<p><strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
I found a device called Just5 Big Button Amplified Cell Phone and it was made specifically for consumers who might normally have problems using common cell phones because of the keys or buttons being too small or the volume being too low, Just5 also offers in call amplification, talking keypad and a one touch emergency call button.</strong></p>
                		<p>Another device I found was the Ultima Electronic Magnifier and Reading Machine with a touchscreen and keypad that was created to help people who have vision problems, it can be used to magnify text and pictures up to 18x, it can scan and read text to you.</p>
                		<p>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>
                		<p>I came across that is made specifically to support Accessibility is called Proloquo2Go and it is an iOS app made for people who have trouble speaking, it has more pleasant human sounding voices for text-to-speech, it will allow the user to select words from an extensive vocabulary and create sentences or they could also just type the sentence and press a button to have the device read the sentence for them.</p>
                		<p>Another app I found made to assist those with visual impairments is called iCanSee which is a really interesting iOS app created to turn the iPhone into a magnifier using the device's camera.
